- 👋 Hi, I’m @GRDavies75
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge and skills towards helping me in my daily work which is Data Analysis .
- 🌱 Goal reached: proficient at Power Query / M, using it in day-to-day work
- 🌱 Goal postponed: learning Test Driven Development (within a Django focused project, Django does not have my interest at the moment)
- 🌱 New Goal: learning the fundamentals/basics of Python (a lengthy but very extensive course, about 50+ %, finished a course with 100+ excercises)
- 🌱 New Goal: learning the fundamentals/basics of Pandas and Polars (not the focus, but for diversity sake and in the end usable knowledge)
- 🌱 New Goal: 100+ excercises Numpy (not started, same as with Pandas, usable knowledge)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. At first I want to grasp the basics of Python, Panda's Numpy, making use of Github.
