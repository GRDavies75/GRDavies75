- 👋 Hi, I’m @GRDavies75
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge and skills towards helping me in my daily work which is Data Analysis .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Powerquery (and M) and thinking about learning Python with a focus on Test-Driven Development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. At first I want to grasp the basics of Python and Test-Driven Development, making use of Github.
